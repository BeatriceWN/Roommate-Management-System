## Database Structure

The application uses SQLite, stored in `db/database.db`.
Tables include:

* `roommates`
* `chores`
* `bills`
* `roommate_bills`

Foreign keys ensure relational integrity between roommates, chores, and bills.

---

## Relationships Explanation

* A **Roommate** can have multiple **Chores**, forming a one-to-many relationship.
* A **Bill** can be shared among multiple **Roommates**, creating a many-to-many relationship via `roommate_bills`.
* The `roommate_bills` table tracks each person’s share and payment status.
* Deleting a roommate automatically removes related chores and bill entries.
* Deleting a bill also removes linked records in `roommate_bills`.

This design ensures consistent and accurate data handling across all operations.

---

## Tech Stack

* **Python 3.10+**
* **SQLite3**
* **Click** for CLI interface
